This project was an assignment in the course "Webdesign II (DIKULT 205)" at he University of Bergen.
The goal of the assignment was to create a fully functional dynamic website from scratch using no frameworks.
On top of it all we had to put just as much effort into a good strategic design and document design choices. 
This was a solo project during one semester as well as an introduction to PHP and the assignment only counted for 60% of the grade. Yes you read that right, professor claimed that the course, which counted half the points of a standard semester, was too important to take along other courses so we should drop everything else and postpone our education for this one course.
